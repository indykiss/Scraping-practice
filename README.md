Project plan:

Scrap the Forbes Global 2000 largest company list CLI: Hi! Welcome to Indy's web scraper of *insert thing being scraped. Please input rank number and I will provide which company (or thing) has that ranking. To add complexity... Would you like to know Forbes's top 100 largest public companies, all of the list, or a specific rank? If top 100, output top 100 If all, output all If rank number, output the company in that rank Notes from Avi's video walkthrough:

Plan project + expected outcome 
Start with project structure. Google is ok. Look at guides and the restaurant example. 
Start with entry point- the file run 
Force that into CLI interface 
Stub out interface M

Program

How do I want the gem to function?

I want to ask the user which ranking they'd like, then provide the company that fits that ranking
Once I have their input, I match it to the "rank" class then output the company name, "name" class
(For more complexity could also output company's profits OR add more options than just ranking. Can output all the 200 companies or top 100, etc)
Can I do that? Not 100% sure how to connect the exact ranking with the correct company name. Maybe push all companies/ rankings into arrays then output by indexing, ex: rank[input + 1] - company[input + 1].
What classes am I using?

# RankingScraper

Project plan:

- Scrap the Forbes Global 2000 largest company list
- CLI:
- Hi! Welcome to Indy's web scraper of *insert thing being scraped. Please input rank number and I will provide which company (or thing) has that ranking. 
- To add complexity... Would you like to know Forbes's top 100 largest public companies, all of the list, or a specific rank? 
- If top 100, output top 100 
- If all, output all 
- If rank number, output the company in that rank 
- 

Notes from Avi's video walkthrough:
1. Plan project, expected outcome 
2. Start with project structure. Google is ok. Look at guides and the restaurant example. 
3. Start with entry point- the file run 
4. Force that into CLI interface 
5. Stub out interface 
6. Make things real
7. Make objects 
8. Program
9. (what?)

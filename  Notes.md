Project plan:

Scrap the Forbes Global 2000 largest company list
CLI:
Hi! Welcome to Indy's web scraper of *insert thing being scraped. Please input rank number and I will provide which company (or thing) has that ranking.
To add complexity... Would you like to know Forbes's top 100 largest public companies, all of the list, or a specific rank?
If top 100, output top 100
If all, output all
If rank number, output the company in that rank
Notes from Avi's video walkthrough:

Plan project, expected outcome
Start with project structure. Google is ok. Look at guides and the restaurant example.
Start with entry point- the file run
Force that into CLI interface
Stub out interface
Make things real
Make objects
Program


How do I want the gem to function? 
- I want to ask the user which ranking they'd like, then provide the company that fits that ranking
- Once I have their input, I match it to the "rank" class then output the company name, "name" class
- (For more complexity could also output company's profits OR add more options than just ranking. Can output all the 200 companies or top 100, etc)
- Can I do that? Not 100% sure how to connect the exact ranking with the correct company name. Maybe push all companies/ rankings into arrays then output by indexing, ex: rank[input + 1] - company[input + 1]. 



What classes am I using?
